# Static dispatch campaign

Goal: bind every call at lowering time, so the runtime never resolves a
member by name. That retires the dispatch ladders and the memoization
layered over them, and it is the prerequisite a bytecode VM needs — a
packed instruction stream cannot fall back to a name walk.

Everything below is measured on `PausableCompositionTests.resumeOnBackgroundThread`
(rob) with the ReleaseFast harness, via `KLIO_DISPATCH_STATS=1`.

## Where dispatch goes today

78.3M call-form instructions execute per run:

| form | count | share |
|---|---|---|
| `call_member_virtual` (name-based) | 64.80M | **82.8%** |
| `call_value` | 4.76M | 6.1% |
| `call_static` | 4.69M | 6.0% |
| `call_member_or_global` | 3.70M | 4.7% |
| `call_member_resolved` | 43K | **0.06%** |
| `call_virtual_slot` | 61K | **0.08%** |

The two static mechanisms that already exist — the `resolved` FuncId bake
and the `CallVirtual` method slot — fire on **0.14% of calls combined**.

The 64.80M name-based member dispatches account fully as:

| tail | count | share of member calls |
|---|---|---|
| `member_flat_prepare` (cache hit -> flat activation) | 29.08M | 44.9% |
| `member_fast_subscript` (`a[i]` served inline) | 19.86M | 30.7% |
| `member_ladder` (full name walk) | 15.28M | 23.6% |
| `member_range_iter` | 0.58M | 0.9% |

So the prize splits in two: 29.1M calls that a runtime cache already
resolves monomorphically (pure waste — lowering could have baked them),
and 15.3M that walk the ladder every time.

`member_fast_subscript` at 19.9M is worth noting separately: those are
`get`/`set` member calls that `fastSubscript` serves inline. They should
not be `CallMember` instructions at all — lowering has an `Index`
instruction for exactly this.

## Why static binding covers only 6.2% of sites

`lowerResolvedMemberCall` is the right mechanism and already does the
right thing: a final/private target becomes `Call(FuncId)`, an overridable
one becomes `CallVirtual(MethodSlotId)`. Per-site census over the same
run (`[lower-sites]`):

| outcome | sites | share |
|---|---|---|
| declined: **no receiver type** | 18,986 | **72.3%** |
| declined: resolver could not pick | 3,749 | 14.3% |
| declined: no ClassId for the type name | 1,679 | 6.4% |
| bound -> `CallVirtual` | 984 | 3.8% |
| bound -> static `Call` | 646 | 2.5% |

The gate is its first line: `const ty = declared_ty orelse return .none`.
Nearly three quarters of member call sites decline because the lowerer
does not know the receiver's static type.

## The actual blocker, and it is small

A type-head channel from typeck to the lowerer already exists —
`Module.eagerTypeOf(span)`, consumed additive-only by `argDeclTypeRef`.
It carries **nothing**: `KLIO_TYPEHEAD_AUDIT=1` reports zero fills and
zero disagreements, because `computeEagerCalls` opens with

    if (runtime.getenvSlice("KLIO_EAGER") == null) return null;

With `KLIO_EAGER=1` the channel populates well — 12,628 type heads, 4,978
call resolutions, 1,879 lambda receiver heads, 5,922 param shapes — but
the eager resolver then rejects the compose corpus with **8 errors across
3 files, all one class**: `unresolved reference 'it'`, at lambdas passed
to a member function whose parameter type needs the receiver type to
find:

    slots.read { it.anchor() }                 // SlotTableTests.kt
    table.read { it.anchor(group) }            // SlotTable.kt:3507

`read` is a member of `SlotTable` taking `(SlotReader) -> T`. The
resolver cannot bind `it` without knowing the lambda's arity, cannot know
the arity without resolving `read`, and cannot resolve `read` without the
receiver type — the same missing fact, one layer earlier.

## Phases

**Phase 0 — open the type channel.** Fix the `it` binding for a lambda
argument to a member function (8 sites, one mechanism), then verify
`KLIO_EAGER` typechecks the whole corpus. Flip the channel from
env-gated to default-on once the audit shows zero disagreement, which is
the trust discipline `argDeclTypeRef` already documents. Nothing
downstream pays off before this.

**Phase 1 — widen the receiver-type answer.** With the channel open,
re-measure `[lower-sites]`. The 72.3% `no_receiver_type` bucket is the
number to drive down; the 6.4% `no_class_id` and 14.3%
`resolver_declined` buckets get their own passes afterwards.

**Phase 2 — lower `a[i]` as `Index`.** 19.9M `member_fast_subscript`
dispatches should never reach the member arm.

**Phase 3 — retire the runtime caches.** Once `[dispatch-stats]` shows
`member_ladder` and `member_flat_prepare` near zero, the TL and shared
dispatch caches (`tl_method_cache`, `tl_ext_cache`, `tl_resolve_cache`,
`tl_perm_cache`, `ext_method_cache`, the member-resolve memos) have no
remaining callers and come out. Measure after removing them: they cost
real time on every miss.

**Phase 4 — bytecode VM.** Only meaningful once dispatch is static. Note
the measurements already recorded in `interpreter-performance-plan.md`:
widening `Inst` from 120 to 200 bytes cost 0%, and adding a whole extra
call per instruction cost 0%. A denser encoding and a tighter dispatch
loop are therefore NOT where the win is — the win in phase 4 is that a
statically bound call needs no resolution at all, which phases 0-3
deliver on their own. Treat the re-encoding as optional cleanup, not as
a performance change, unless a fresh measurement says otherwise.

## Instrumentation

`KLIO_DISPATCH_STATS=1` prints both censuses at run end: `[dispatch-stats]`
(executed call forms and member sub-tails) and `[lower-sites]` (static-gate
coverage per call site). Both are free when off — rob measures 43.3-43.7s
with them compiled in against a 43.8-44.2s baseline.
